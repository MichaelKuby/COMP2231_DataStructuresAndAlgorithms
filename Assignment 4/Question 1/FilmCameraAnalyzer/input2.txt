You want the Nikon L35AF, my friend.
This is the sweet spot. It is ALL ABOUT the Olympus Stylus Epic.
Check out the Nikon 35Ti my friend, and enjoy.
You get what you pay for, and you want to pay for the Contax T2.
You want the VERY TRUSTED Nikon F2.
You won't find much better than the Leica R 6.2.
I think you want the very cute Canon Canonet G-III QL17.
Look no further than the legendary Leica M6.
Then you probably want the very versatile Pentax 6x7.
Tugging on my heart strings with the Mamiya Rz67 Proii. The Annie Liebovitz camera... before she got all weird.
Then check out the Minolta Autocord series. Not super expensive, but super everything else.
Then you almost certainly want the Hasselblad 500cm, or if you have the cash, go for the 501cm.
Shooting 4x5! Nice. I have heard very good things about the Chamonix 45F-2.
Now we're talking. Spend up on that Arca-Swiss F-Field C 4x4 View Camera. The last camera you'll ever own.
People rave about the Intrepid 8x10 MK2. Big ups for shooting the big stuff!
I'm sweating. Buy that Arca-Swiss M-Monolith 8x10 View Camera. Only $10,000 USD.
